# Darknet-NG 12 Badge for DEF CON 31 Case

This is the repo for my modfied badge it forked from https://github.com/darknet-ng/Darknet-NG-12-Badge

There were a few tweaks I wanted such as the ability to easily secure the face and back to the badge so I started making modifications.
After that there were a few small things that I wanted to chage such as to reduce overhang, enlargen the screen view a little.

Overall all the parts of this badge should be comptiable with the original badge as of commit 665bda3 in https://github.com/darknet-ng/Darknet-NG-12-Badge

The body should be printed so the front faces down / rests on the print surface.
